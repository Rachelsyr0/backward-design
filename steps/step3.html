    <h1> Objective 3 - Take care of sunflowers </h1>
    <p><b> # 3 SKILLS FOR YOU # </b></p>
    <ul>
      <li> Apply fertilizer - Although sunflowers don't need a lot of fertilizer, a little fertilizer can make them brighter and fuller. Start with a little liquid plant fertilizer with high nitrogen, then switch to a fertilizer with high phosphorus when the buds are about to bloom. </li>
      <li> Adjust the location -  When young plants are grown, they need a lot of sunlight so that their stems are strong enough to support the larger heads. Sunflower plants need six to eight hours of sunlight a day to grow. </li>
      <li> Tie up - Some shorter varieties do not need to be held in place, while sunflowers that grow to 90 cm or more need to be held in place to prevent their heads from hanging down. </li>
    </ul>
